# Project Rules

This project uses `CLAUDE.md` as the single source of truth for all architectural decisions, coding standards, and development workflows.

You must read `CLAUDE.md` at the beginning of your session to understand:
- Project Overview & Architecture
- Development Commands
- Coding Style & Linting Rules
- Database & Migration Guidelines (Critical!)

All generated code and proposed changes MUST adhere to the guidelines set forth in `CLAUDE.md`.
